Aladia comes with a starter skeleton admin dashboard for all official projects.
Here are some rules we want you to follow:

- Write clean code

## Aladia ERP is based on NestJs

## üè† Architecture

Folder & Files architecture
```jsx
- src
    - pages (all pages relative to /admin url)
      - dashboard
      - settings
      - users 
      - orders
      - ...and so on... Every folder must have ```kebab``` style name
    - lib
        - api (folder - contains all api files with all actions)
    - shared (folder - contains all components shared between the app)
      - dashboard
      - settings
      - users 
      - orders
      - ...and so on... Every folder must have ```kebab``` style name
- assets
    - styles (we use .scss, so all)
        - components (folder - contains all style files for every custom class component)
            - _sidebar.scss
            - _topnav.scss
        - pages (folder - contains all style files for every custom class page)
            - _dashboard.scss
            - _settings.scss
        index.scss (root index files to import scss styling)
    - fonts (not required - folder contains custom fonts or icons .woff)
    - images (folder - contains all static images required)
- public (logo & favicon.ico)
